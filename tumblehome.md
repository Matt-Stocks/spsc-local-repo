        <h3>Tumblehome</h3>
        <div class="para-div">
            <p>My life started beside the ocean and it has always been a
              neighbour Iâ€™ve found myself gravitating back to over the years.
              To me the sea is one of the key elements of living in Cornwall,
              it permeates daily life. It surrounds us, provides for us, and is
              traversed upon.</p>
            <p>The Tumblehome collection is based on marine architecture, more
              specifically the curvature of boat hulls. The curve of a
              Tumblehome boat is widest at the water line and tapers at both
              above and below the water. I worked this concept into the notion
              that the sea and the human body are the same curving, biological
              mass that both cup and hold objects in the same way. Leading me
              to design a minimal object with these parameters, which drew me
              to form tumblers, plates and bowls. A neat, non cluttered and
              direct connection could be created between object and person.
              But also their simple function and form gave me an outlet to
              provide people with that same tactile and satisfying experience
              in which working with clay gives me. </p>
