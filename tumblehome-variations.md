        <h3>Tumblehome Variations</h3>
        <div class="para-div">
            <p>Tumblehome is the first collection I created for Studio DOR &
               TAN, inspired by marine architecture. A more in-depth talk about
                this can be found <a href="tumblehome.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>The Tumblehome collection was made in one colour, a natural
              white glaze and a sandy hued clay. Designed to be classic and
              tactile in tone and profile. I was asked by DOR & TAN to create
              the same form in different clay and glaze combinations of my own
              choice. Colour is a difficult area when you want to keep a concept
               ageless, so instead I opted for texture first. Often surface is
               underrated and ignored as the soul of a piece when it comes to
               tableware. So I went with a groggy charcoal clay, minimal, simple
                but aesthetically different from the norm. </p>
            <p>Another option was pattern, pattern is not seen as minimal, but
              wood, earth, and metal, all have their own subtle unsystematic
              sequences. We donâ€™t consider any of these elements as garish, so
              the answer must be naturally occurring disorder. I wanted to use
              a clay which added pattern organically to a piece, not by my hand
               but reaction. I experimented with a couple of flecked and toasted
                clays for this and found a perfectly balanced fleck in terms of
                negative space, hue and added texture. </p>
