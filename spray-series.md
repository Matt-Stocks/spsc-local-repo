        <h3>Spray Series</h3>
        <div class="para-div">
            <p>When creating this collection of small bowls I was influenced by
              Claude Monetâ€™s Rouen Cathedral series. He rented a studio across
              the road from the catherdal and spent two years painting over
              forty paintings of the gothic cathedral at different times of the
              day. Which in itself is an incredible feat of dedication and
              perfection in studying light and form. </p>
            <p>St Ives is where I reside and as the legend goes with artists, it
               does possess incredible light and natural beauty. Porthmeor was
               the chosen spot of study as it's been a place I've seen steadily
               change over the years. But instead of looking at the apparent
               physical changes, I settled my mind and focus on the subtle
               adjustments in light over the hours. It was not until mixing
               the glazes in the studio that I attained the real significance
               I wanted these pieces to convey, to reflect upon the moments
               and capture the small occurrences.</p>
